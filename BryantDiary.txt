 General thoughts
 ---------------------
 It was hard to do proper tdd. I always wanted to write code before writing a test.
 I rarely was able to write just enough code to get it to pass the test. I was always thinking about
 how to make the code modular and how it was going to interact with code in the future. 
 
 It is hard to fit in time to program after work. Which can be seen in the infrequent 
 work at the beginning of the project.
 
 Pair programming was interesting. When we pair programmed the code was better, and we both were on the same page.
 For the things we programmed separately, I think it took longer and it needed more refactoring.
